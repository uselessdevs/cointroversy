## Totem ERC721 contracts

### Deploying to the Rinkeby network.

1. You'll need to sign up for [Infura](https://infura.io). and get an API key.
2. Using your API key and the mnemonic for your Metamask wallet (make sure you're using a Metamask seed phrase that you're comfortable using for testing purposes), run:

```
export INFURA_KEY="<infura_key>"; export MNEMONIC="<metmask_mnemonic>"; truffle deploy --network rinkeby
```

### Minting tokens.

After deploying to the Rinkeby network, there will be a contract on Rinkeby that will be viewable on [Rinkeby Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io). For example, here is a [recently deployed contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/xxxxx). You should set this contract address and the address of your Metamask account as environment variables when running the minting script:

```
export INFURA_KEY="<infura_key>"; export MNEMONIC="<metmask_mnemonic>"; export OWNER_ADDRESS="<my_address>"; export CONTRACT_ADDRESS="<deployed_contract_address>"; export NETWORK="rinkeby"; node scripts/mint.js
```
